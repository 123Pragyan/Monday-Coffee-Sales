Objective:
This project aims to develop a solution for a hypothetical business challenge. It is a guided project in which I have analyzed Monday Coffee's sales data to identify the top three cities in India for opening new coffee shop locations, focusing on consumer demand and sales performance.
Below are the conclusions:
#City: Pune
1.	Average rent per customer is very low.
2.	Highest total revenue.
3.	Average sales per customer is also high.
#City: Delhi
1.	Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.
2.	Highest total number of customers, which is 68.
3.	Average rent per customer is 330 (still under 500).
#City: Jaipur
1.	Highest number of customers, which is 69.
2.	Average rent per customer is very low at 156.
3.	Average sales per customer is better at 11.6k.
Lastly, I would like to thank the ‘Zero Analyst’ YouTube channel for providing with all necessary data and explanations to proceed with the analysis.
