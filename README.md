Objective:
This project aims to develop a solution for a hypothetical business challenge. It is a guided project in which I have analyzed Monday Coffee's sales data to identify the top three cities in India for opening new coffee shop locations, focusing on consumer demand and sales performance.
# Below are the Conclusions

## City: Pune
- Average rent per customer is very low.
- Highest total revenue.
- Average sales per customer is also high.

## City: Delhi
- Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.
- Highest total number of customers, with 68.
- Average rent per customer is ₹330 (still under ₹500).

## City: Jaipur
- Highest number of customers, totaling 69.
- Average rent per customer is very low at ₹156.
- Average sales per customer is better at ₹11.6k.
